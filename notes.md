# Notes
This is a file to just store thoughts about the project

## Aug 22, 2024
- Ok so I got the window resizeable, but may have gotten carried away overcomplicating the screen drawing
- When I take a look at the project again I'm probs gonna delete most of the code associated with the engine file
    - Since It's just so bad 
- Shiny and I talked about some themes for the game last night
- I love the theme where you're trying to find dungeons for goblins
- It's just so quirky
- But I've grinded on this for almost two and a half hours now, and I need a break
